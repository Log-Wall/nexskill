//Raising his right hand, Amranu sharply snaps his fingers.
//Something undulates and writhes beneath the skin of Tabethys, before a cloud of chittering blackness struggles forth from her wounds.

//Amranu raises his right hand, and snaps his fingers.
//A tide of writhing bodies boils up from the ground, descending upon Tabethys and burrowing into her flesh in a gnawing chittering mass.

//Amranu raises his right hand, and snaps his fingers.
//A great black cloud of buzzing humming darkness rises up, descending upon Tabethys all at once in a wave of stinging death.
